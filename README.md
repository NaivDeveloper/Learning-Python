# Learning how to code.
I am 15. Recently ive started studying Youtube Videos on Python and CSS. I am more enversed in Python due to its simplicity, but i have taken a interest in C++ due to its compatibility with not only web development, but also firmware. Ive started learning on the 7th of feburary and today is the 11th of feburary. I will post every project i make (small or large) so that in the future, universities or employers can see the progress ive made, and how long it took me. I hope that i will learn these languages quickly so future employers can see my skills and mindset. I will primarily focus on C++ and take Python on the side.
