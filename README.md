# Learning-Python
I am 15. I have just started learning Python Online today and have made decent progress. Ive learnt about variables, values, booleans, floats, strings, lists, intergers, inputs etc.
Im planning to post all of my progress and mini projects on this respiratory.
I started learning HTML and CSS first and got a good grasp on it, before quickly switching to python due to it being more versatile and easy to understand. 
If you still see me posting 2 years from now, my goal of mastering Python will be complete and i will be prepared for College.
