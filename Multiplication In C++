#Made my first ever code blocks in C++. Ive shown interest in the language due to its compatibility with both web development and game creation.
#Its the most complex, wich explained why it took me 2 hours to understand this code wich i could have made in Python without breaking a sweat.
#Ive fully memorized it, and all its components now and hopefully i can learn C++.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int Multiply(int a, int b)
{
	return a * b;
}

void MultiplyFactor(int a, int b)
{
	int result = (a, b);
	std::cout << result << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
	MultiplyFactor(3, 6);
	MultiplyFactor(5, 7);
    MultiplyFactor(8, 5);
}
